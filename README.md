# statsd-zig

Basic DogStatsD implementation supporting gauges and counters.

## Getting started

- Build the binary with `zig build`. You will need a recent master version of the
toolchain (>= zig master 2020-07-12)
- Use the environment variables `APIKEY` and `HOSTNAME` to configure the daemon
- Launch the daemon and start throwing it counters and gauges

## Memory usage

Thanks to Zig not having a default memory allocator, I completely control every
bytes of memory allocated in this daemon (even the memory allocated in the
standard library).

The pattern I've used let me free all the memory allocated for metrics processing
once it has reached a certain amount, meaning that the total memory used is
capped to a configurable maximum (set `MAX_MEM_MB`, default value 256).
